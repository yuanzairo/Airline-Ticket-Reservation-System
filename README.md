# ‚úàÔ∏è Airline Ticket Reservation System

A desktop-based Airline Ticket Reservation System developed in Java Swing. This project demonstrates the design of a graphical user interface that allows users to manage flight schedules, passengers, and ticket bookings. The system integrates two versions of Dijkstra‚Äôs Algorithm (dijkstra() and dijkstra2()) to determine the shortest and most efficient routes between destinations. Additionally, HashMaps are used to store and retrieve data quickly, reducing search time and improving system performance.

## üß≠ Project Overview
Airline Reservation System allows its users to:

- Search and display available flights between major cities.
- Reserve and view flight tickets.
- Manage passenger information.
- Calculate and display the shortest or most efficient travel route using Dijkstra‚Äôs Algorithm.
- Utilize HashMap structures for efficient data storage and retrieval.

All data (such as bookings, routes, and passengers) is stored in MySql.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository: https://github.com/yuanzairo/Airline-Ticket-Reservation-System.git
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE (e.g., NetBeans, IntelliJ IDEA).
3. Run the AirlineTicketReservationSystem.java file.

**Application Flow:**
1. Launch the system.
2. Login window for authentication (User: Admin | Pass: 12345).
3. Add flights and destinations to populate the list.
4. Use the booking module to reserve a flight for a passenger.
5. View existing reservations.
6. Use the route optimization feature to compute the shortest path between cities.
7. Compare algorithm performance in the dashboard panel.

## Enhancement Recommendations
- Specify 13 cities
- Comparison of running time
- Table of comparison between Dijkstra 1 and 2 in the Results and Discussion
